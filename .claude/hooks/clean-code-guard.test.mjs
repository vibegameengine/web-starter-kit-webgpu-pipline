/**
 * Runs the guard as a process, the way Claude Code runs it: JSON on stdin, JSON
 * on stdout. Anything less would miss the failures this suite exists for, all of
 * which were in the plumbing rather than in the measurement.
 *
 * Two of them are here because they happened. The drive letter: Windows hands the
 * same file back as `C:\…` or `c:\…`, and a strict compare against the baseline
 * missed the entry — which fails CLOSED, blocking exactly the recorded files the
 * ratchet exists to let through. And the silent exit: every give-up path returned
 * 0 with no output, so "measured, clean" and "never ran" were the same bytes.
